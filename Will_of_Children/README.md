Attached are two versions of the 'Will_of_Children' experiment ran February 2024 at LILA Burbank with
7-8th graders and LILA Los Feliz with 3rd-6th graders. The 9-12 is a small mistake in upload name.
This experiment is itself an adaption of  "Interpreting the Will of the People: A Positive Analysis
of Ordinal Preference Aggregation" by P Douglas Bernheim and Sandro Ambuehl. It takes the first 12 
perference profiles in that paper (stored in the csv). and adjusts the interface for children.

There are only minor interface changes between the two versions and an extra task for the (9-12) version.

Codebook is attached.
