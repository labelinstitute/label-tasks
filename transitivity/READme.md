The folder contains the otree code to run an experiment based on 2 tasks. On Task 1, the subject makes pairwise choices between two food items. On Task 2, the subject ranks the 7 options by dragging and dropping them in 7 boxes. After this ranking, the payments to each subject are calculated. 
Task 1 and Task 2 are coded in the folder food_good. Payments are coded in the folder payment. These are the only two folders to focus on. 
The pictures used for Tasks 1 and 2 are included in the _static folder, and thereâ€™s a html template for each page in the _templates folder. 

As stated in the requirements document, the experiment is coded for oTree 5.9.8 and Python 3.11.
