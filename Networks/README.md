Here is a description of the files in this folder

Network_Signals is a version of the network experiment we ran March 2024 at Oscar De La Hoya High School. In this version, each network member receives a signal
of a color with a 60% chance of the signal being accurate. Adjustments can be made in the mechanism csv files when the file is unziped.
These files are particular to a certain network size

Network_6 is a version of the network experiment we ran April 2024 at LILA Los Feliz for K through 2nd Grade. In this version, each network member can choose
colors and the program stops when all have converged.
Note, however, that Network_6 is actually a more advanced version of Network-Signals capable of running the same stuff as Network-Signals. On top of this, Network_6:
- has the ability to change what colors and how many colors a participant can choose
- can decide whether to stop when all players have converged
- Whether signals are received or not
- These changes are outlined in the guidebook in this folder. Both versions are kept though because Network_6 includes interface adjsutments for younger children.
  
Network_movies is a program that turns the 'Action' csv output produced by either network program into a short film that allows us to see progress. Instructions are
in the README.docx file attached.
NOTE: File network_10.csv in network_movies is slightly different from network_10.csv in network_signals and network_6. This is because of a flaw in network_movies. DO NOT 
USE ONE TO SUBSTITUTE FOR THE OTHERS.
